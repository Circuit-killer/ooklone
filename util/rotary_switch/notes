we have a rotary switch of n_switch = 12 positions.
we measure the switch position using an adc. we want
switch positions to result in an adc values that are
as widely spaced as possible from one another, esp.
with low resolution adc. lets do the maths.

if the adc has n_adc bits and the switch has n_switch
positions, we have an adc_step value of:
adc_step = n_adc / n_switch
also:
adc_hi = pow2(n_adc)

if v_ref is the adc reference voltage and adc_i is
the value in volts measured by the adc at switch
position i, we have the following relation:
adc_i = v_ref / adc_hi * (adc_step * i) (eq_0)

also, we have from the resistor divider network eq:
v_out = v_ref * rdiv_2 / (rdiv_1 + rdiv_2)
in our case, rdiv_1 is the resistor value we want to
compute for every switch position. Lets call it r_i,
we have:
v_i = v_ref * rdiv_2 / (r_i + rdiv_2) (eq_1)

in eq_0 and eq_1, adc_i and v_i are the same.
thus, by equating eq_0 and eq_1:
v_ref / adc_hi * (adc_step * i) = v_ref * rdiv_2 / (r_i + rdiv_2)
(adc_step * i) / adc_hi = rdiv_2 / (r_i + rdiv_2)
(adc_step * i) / (adc_hi * rdiv_2) = 1 / (r_i + rdiv_2)

r_i = (adc_hi * rdiv_2) / (adc_step * i) - rdiv_2 (eq_2)

in our case, we arbitrarly choose rdiv_2 = 1000 ohms. Note
that you can play on this value to scale the other resistors.
It is useful if like me you are peeking resistors from a set
already available.

Also, r_0 cannot be computed (division by zero). We should
chose it so that it is big enough, le say 10 * r_2. in our
case, it results in the following values:
